It’s atmosphere is covered by a deep, penumbral shroud that lets very little light shine through, but absorbs no heat, thus allowing for a unique surface of dark trees and bio-luminescent fungi. When the first Protectorate explorers touched down on the surface of this planet, they had already feared the worst from its oppressive atmosphere, but what they weren’t expecting was to make first contact with a race of fearsome, but otherwise curious and intelligent aliens.\n\nDubbed the “Arachne” by the explorers, as their own name for themselves is nigh unpronounceable by most other peoples, this species had been living in and developed on this planet for several millennia, dwelling underground in vast, beautiful, carved out cities. Their origin is a mystery that scholars and archaeologists have only just begun to explore and uncover, as the Arachne themselves only know little past their immediate governments and histories. The surface of the planet is dotted with sparse ruins of pure black stonework, hinting at a dark and ancient origin, but little is available past this.\n\nThe Arachne homeworld is divided between several noble houses, each founded by the descendants of the first sentient members of their race. The territory of each noble house is a county, with baronies being established within. Thus, Arachne Barons or Baronesses answer to Counts or Countesses. Legend tells of a great Spider King, from whom all are descended from and will unite the houses, but no such claims to such a line have stood against the test of time. Each ruling house represents a different “sub-breed” of Arachne, and as such, a skilled cultural xeno-archaeologist can identify which house an Arachne hails from simply by the colours and design of their chitin.\n\nOnce it was discovered that these aliens were friendly and not, in fact, man-eating space bugs (they prefer dining on fungi and the meat and eggs of the large insects native to their homeworld), the Protectorate introduced the species to the concept of space-travel, which immediately sparked a surge of wanderlust and curiosity in the Arachne. For generations they believed that nothing lied beyond the dark veil of their homeworld, and that was simply where existence ended. Upon discovering otherwise, however, the race eagerly took to the stars and began making a name for themselves by trading fine silks and being fierce warriors. Now it’s something of a tradition for young, prodigious Arachne to leave their planet in a coming of age ceremony, who then explore the wonders of the universe and eventually return to their people with new discoveries, knowledge, and technology.\n\n[h1][b][i]Credits:[/i][/b][/h1]\n\n\"Meme Trash\": Some assets in the mod.\nAntyrus: Original mod.
